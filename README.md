Virtual Economy framework will help you to create applications related to Web3, Blockchains, IoT, NFTs, Cryptocurrencies and other useful technologies.

This project is OpenSource for personal, educational and commercial use also :)

Main framework is .NET Standard 2.1 (VEDriversLite).
Code is written in C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Solution is for Visual Studio 2019.

Repository now contains new version of drivers for Neblio and Doge: VEDriversLite. It is also available as [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VEFramework.VEDriversLite/). Please check this drivers and [documentation](https://docs.veframework.com/VEDriversLite/index.html). 

We recommend to use VEDriversLite if you need to build app which uses just Neblio or Doge!

Please explore [VE NFT App](https://ve-nft.com/) - C# [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) Neblio NFT Web Wallet which uses VEDriversLite.

Web Wallet with integrated NFT minting and marketplace.

## Aidrop of tokens and Neblio for testing

Do you need the tokens and some Neblio for testing and development? Please visit [VENFT App Project Page](https://about.ve-nft.com/#airdrop).

# Other Projects

This repository contains also project examples for Arduino IDE. It is developed on M5StickC HW. It is based on ESP32 MCU (official page: [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/)). These projects you can find in folder [Examples-ArduinoIDE-M5StickC](https://github.com/fyziktom/VirtualEconomyFramework/tree/main/Examples/ArduinoIDE/M5StickC).

For compilation you need to install Arduino IDE and M5Stack libraries and ESP32 libraries into IDE ([Guidlines](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/arduino/arduino_development)).
